title: "Final Project"
---

## Description

The final project will consist of a poster-length report summarizing an analysis of your choice, coded in R and presented within a R Markdown document.  The topic can be related to the studentâ€™s research interests or a separate topic.

Your project does not have to involve big data or big, complicated analyses.  I'm looking for a demonstration of your creativity and programming skills.  A small but well designed project is better than a large but incomplete one.  Please focus on quality over quantity.  

One limitation is that your project must use publicly accessible data. If you want to use your own data, you must make it available on a website (e.g. [Figshare](figshare.org) or [Github](github.com)) so that others are able to re-run your code. Also check out [ROpenSci](https://ropensci.org/packages/) which has libraries that can pull data from many different sources.  You can also download data from publicly accessible servers.

### Requirements

Complete submissions will include and be graded as follows:

1. **Title** (<25 words)
2. **Introduction  [~ 200 words, 10%]**
    * Clearly stated background and questions / hypotheses / problems being addressed. Sets up the analysis in an interesting and compelling way.
3. **Materials and methods [~ 200 words]**
    * **Narrative (10%)**: Clear narrative description of the data sources and methods. Includes data from at least two sources that were integrated / merged in R.
    * **Code (25%)**: The code associated with the project is well organized and easy to follow. Demonstrates mastery of R graphics and functions.
    * **Data (5%)**: The underlying data are publicly accessible via the web and downloaded/accessed within the Rmd script. If you want to use your own data, you must make it available on a website (e.g. [Figshare](figshare.org)) so that others are able to re-run your code.
4. **Results [~200 words, 25%]**
    * Tables and figures (maps and other graphics) are carefully planned to convey the results of your analysis. Intense exploration and evidence of many trials and failures. The author looked at the data in many different ways before coming to the final presentation of the data.
5. **Conclusions [~200 words, 5%]**
    * Clear summary adequately describing the results and putting them in context. Discussion of further questions and ways to continue investigation.
6. **References [5%]**
  * All sources are cited in a consistent manner
7. **General Scores**
  * **General organization (10%)**: Clear labels/headings demarcate separate sections. Excellent flow from one section to the next. Tables and graphics carefully tuned and placed for desired purpose.The 'story' is very well organized, makes good use of graphics, and is easy to understand.
  * **General Grammar (5%)**: All sentences are well constructed and have varied structure and length. The author makes no errors in grammar, mechanics, and/or spelling.

See the project rubric below for more details and examples.

Note that the word counts are quite short (~200 words per section).  This does not mean it's _easy_!  In fact, conveying all the necessary information succinctly often takes extra effort.  If English is not your first language, you are encouraged to contact the UB Writing Center to get help writing succinctly and clearly.

## Formatting

The final project will be produced as a [RMarkdown document](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) that includes all the steps necessary to run the analysis and produce the output (figures, tables,etc.).  For examples of similar documents, explore the [RPubs website](https://rpubs.com). 

### Figures
Figures (maps and other graphics) are a vital component of scientific communication and you should carefully plan your figures to convey the results of your analysis.

### Source and Output Files

You will upload the following files to UBlearns:

1) the source (`.Rmd`) 	file
2) an html version
3) a PDF version of the formatted document for feedback and grading.  

The HTML is for archival and sharing in the class projects.  Let me know if you would prefer your final project to not be posted on the course website.  The PDF version and your code (`.R` or `.Rmd` file) will be graded (see rubric below). The only reason I need a PDF is UBLearns will not allow direct feedback on a HTML file.   To make the pdf, I recommend you compile the `.Rmd` document to HTML (as explained [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html)) and then open the html file in a browser (chrome, explorer, safari, etc.) and print it / save it as a PDF.  This is the preferred route as you also get the HTML version this way.

It is also possible to compile the `.Rmd` document directly to PDF as explained [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html). 

### References
You should cite any relevant materials (including data sources and methods) in the text using a standard author-date citation format (e.g. Wilson, 2015) and then described in a References section.  You can either compile the references manually (e.g. cutting and pasting the citation into the references section) or use the automated system in RMarkdown explained [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html).   Other citation styles are acceptable as long as they are consistent, complete, and easy to understand.  

## Project Phases

### Project proposal

The project proposal will be 1 page or less and outline the following:

1.  Introduction to problem/question
2.  Links to inspiring examples:  Include links to a few (~3-5) example graphics found on the internet that are somehow similar to what you want to do.
2.  Proposed data sources
3.  Proposed methods
4.  Expected results

### First Draft
The first draft of your project will be assessed by your peers in UBlearns.  You will pick two projects and evaluate them according to the rubric below.  The objectives of the peer evaluation are:

* Expose you to the work of your peers so you know what others are working on
* Provide an opportunity to share your knowledge to improve their project

You will download your peer's .Rmd file, run it in RStudio, and assess it as follows: 

1) The .Rmd produces HTML output with:
   * section headers for all the major sections of the paper
   * a draft of the complete introduction.  
   Be sure to install any required libraries (do not deduct points if it fails because you don't have a library installed).
2) Introduction  [~ 200 words]: Clearly stated background and questions / hypotheses / problems being addressed. Sets up the analysis in an interesting and compelling way.
3) Data: Script downloads at least one dataset automatically through the internet.  This could use a direct download (e.g. download.file()) or an API (anything from ROpenSci).
4) The HTML file includes at least one figure of the data.

### Second Draft
The more complete the second draft, the more feedback I'll be able to provide to ensure an excellent final project.  So it's in your interest to finish as much as possible.    In addition to the details from the first draft, I would like to drafts of the text in each section as well as at least code that see at least one figure illustrating the data you are working with.  If you include drafts of the results and discussion/conclusion I will also give you feedback on those sections.  

The second draft will be graded using the same criteria as the full project (see above), but I do not expect to see final versions of the discussion and conclusion.  If you have questions or comments, feel free to include them in the draft (e.g., "I'm planning to do X, but I'm not sure how to organize the data appropriately") or as a _comment_ in the UBLearns submission webpage.  

### Project Presentation

On the last day of class, each student will give a 5 minute overview of their project to the class.  You will open the html version on the screen (no need to make a separate presentation).  It's OK if not all the text will be readable on the screen (as you know the projector is really low resolution).

Time will be tight for this final day, so please practice so that you will stay within the 5 minute time period.   The objectives of this presentation are primarily to share your work with your classmates and hopefully give you more ideas of ways you can use programming (and R) in your research.

### Final Draft

The final draft will be uploaded to UBLearns at the end of the semester and posted on the course website.

**Remember to upload the HTML, PDF, and  `.Rmd` files! **

Much open data is available on the web, and the WebTechnologies TaskView addresses how to obtain and parse web-based data. There is obvious overlap between the two TaskViews, so some packages are described on both. There is also a considerable amount of open data available as R packages on CRAN.
