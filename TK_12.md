## Evaluation Instructions

Select two repositories and evaluate them according to the instructions and rubric below.  

1) Explore the final projects in the [class repositor](https://github.com/AdamWilsonLabEDU)
2) Open the repository and check if there have already been two reviews by checking if there are 2 (or more) "Pull Requests".  For example, in the image below, there are 0 pull requests, so this repository would be available for you to review.  If there are already 2 pull requests, select another repository. ![](assets/pull_reqeust.png)
2) Go to the github page linked in the assignment and download the repository as a zip file (click on the <img src='assets/download.png' width=100> button).
3) Unzip the file after it downloads
4) Open the project or `index.Rmd` in RStudio and click `knit` or  `Build Website` in the `Build` tab in the upper right.

Evaluate the following provide any feedback via pull request.
1) Website
  1) **Introduction**  [~ 200 words]: Clearly stated background and questions / hypotheses / problems being addressed. Sets up the analysis in an interesting and compelling way.
  2) **Data**: Script downloads at least one dataset automatically through the internet.  This could use a direct download (e.g. download.file()) or an API (anything from ROpenSci).
  3) **Figure**: The HTML file includes at least one figure of the data.
2) **Output:** The .Rmd produces HTML output with
  1) section headers for all the major sections of the paper
  2) a draft of the complete introduction.  

Be sure to install any required libraries (do not complain if it fails because you don't have a library installed).
