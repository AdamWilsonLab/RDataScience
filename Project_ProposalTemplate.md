# Introduction to problem/question


# Inspiring Examples

Include links and screenshots (or embedded images) of a few (~3-5) example graphics found on the internet that convey what you want to do.  Include a few sentences about why you selected each link.

## Example 1
![](https://theoreticalecology.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/6307925837_5074118a44_b.jpg)

I found this graphic easy to understand yet rich with detail.  The graphic summarizes political shifts across the nation from Democratic (left) to Republican (right) with simple arrows.  

# Proposed data sources

Be as specific as possible.

# Proposed methods

List the approach you will use. Don't simply list packages, tell me what you will do with them.

# Expected results

Describe what you want to produce (graphics, analyses, etc.)
