## DataCamp in this course

We will use DataCamp to reinforce your learning and assess your development as a data scientist. Throughout the semester, various chapters will be assigned via DataCamp in our [DataCamp 'classroom'](https://www.datacamp.com/enterprise/spatial-data-science).  

You must complete the assigned chapters by the due dates designated in DataCamp.

You are welcome to work collaboratively on the DataCamp assignments but you are responsible for understanding your responses to the various challenges.  So an acceptable question to ask a classmate would be, “which functions did you use to answer number 4?,” while an unacceptable question would be “please email/chat/read me your code for question #4.”
