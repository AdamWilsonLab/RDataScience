#' ## Your problem
#' 
#' You want to make a figure illustrating the distribution of GDP per capita for all countries within each continent using the `world` data in the `spData` package.  Your desired figure looks something like the following:
#' 
#' 
#' You have started working on the figure but can't seem to make it work like you want.  Here is your current version of the code (and the resulting figure):
#' 
## ---- warning=F----------------------------------------------------------
ggplot(world,aes(x=gdpPercap, y=continent, color=continent))+
   geom_density(alpha=0.5,color=F)

#' 
#' You want to ask for help and so you know that you need to make a reproducible example.  Starting with the code above, make the required edits so you can use `reprex()` to generate a nicely formatted example that you could email or post to a forum to ask for help.  See the [reading](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) for more help. Note: you do _not_ need to recreate the figure above, only to use `reprex()` to illustrate your question.
#' 
#' If you have extra time, try to fix the code above to make the first figure.
