```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
source("functions.R")

```

# Reading

```{r reading,results='asis',echo=F}
md_bullet(rmarkdown::metadata$reading)
```

## Course Folder Structure

For the rest of the course, you should keep your files organzed in a git-managed repository.  After syncing your local computer with your class repository, please [download this zipfile](data/GEO503.zip.zip) and then move the folder structure into your local repository (folder).  After you have moved the folders and `pushed` to your GitHub repository, your repo should match the folder structure in the following image.


```{r, out.width="400px", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/folderstructure.png")
```

# Tasks

```{r tasks,results='asis',echo=F}
