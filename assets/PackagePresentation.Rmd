## Animation package

Makes animations!

* probability theory
* mathematical statistics
* multivariate statistics
* nonparametric statistics
* sampling survey
* linear models
* time series
* computational statistics
* data mining
* machine learning 

**Save to Flash, GIF, HTML pages, PDF and videos**

## Basic steps…

1. Uses a ’loop’ to make a series of plots
2. Package ‘combines’ them into an animation

## Example Code: Linear Regression

```{r, results='hide'}
library(animation)
saveGIF({    
ani.options(interval = 0.3, nmax = 50)
  par(
    mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.1),
    mgp = c(2, 0.5, 0),
    tcl = -0.3)
  least.squares()
  },
img.name = "least.squares",
htmlfile = "least.squares.gif",
ani.height = 600, 
ani.width = 1000,
title = "Demonstration of Least Squares")
```

```{r, results='hide'}
library(animation)
saveGIF({    
ani.options(interval = 0.3, nmax = 50)
  par(
    mar = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.1),
    mgp = c(2, 0.5, 0),
    tcl = -0.3)
  least.squares()
  },
img.name = "least.squares",
htmlfile = "least.squares.gif",
ani.height = 600, 
ani.width = 1000,
title = "Demonstration of Least Squares")
```
