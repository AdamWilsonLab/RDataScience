#' ### First Draft
#' 
#' The first draft of your project will be assessed by your peers in GitHub. The objectives of the peer evaluation are:
#' 
#' * Expose you to the work of your peers so you know what others are working on
#' * Provide an opportunity to share your knowledge to improve their project
#' 
#' You should use the project website template (or similar) to generate a html version of your project report. If your project requires any data not available in public repositories, you should put it in a folder called `/data` in your project's home directory and then import it into R with `read.csv('data/filname.csv')` or similar so that anyone with a copy of the repository can re-create the HTML output.
