## Overview
One convenient way to share research details is through a public website that includes all the information needed to reproduce the project.  You will do this for your final project.

Today we will make a copy of a template for your final project, edit it, and 'push' it back up to your github account.  You can check out the template code at [https://github.com/AdamWilsonLab/RDataScience_Project](https://github.com/AdamWilsonLab/RDataScience_Project) and the template website at [http://adamwilson.us/RDataScience_Project/](http://adamwilson.us/RDataScience_Project/)


## Create a copy of the project template in your GitHub account.

Steps:

1. Go to https://github.com/AdamWilsonLab/RDataScience_Project
2. Log into Github using your account
3. Click `fork` near the upper right corner.  This will create a copy in your GitHub Account.  [See here for more details](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
4. After it completes, click the green button "Clone or Download" and copy the URL.

## Clone the project template to your computer
Now you will make a local copy on your computer by creating a new project and 'cloning' the repository you just forked.

1. **File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git**
  * URL: paste from above.  It will be similar to  `https://github.com/AdamWilsonLab/RDataScience_Project.git` but with your username.
  * Project name: you can rename it if you want or keep the default: `RDataScience_Project`
  * Project as subdirectory of `~/Documents/repos` or wherever you want to put it.
2.  It should download the project to your computer then open it to the `index.Rmd` file.

## Play with the project template

1. Select the `Build` tab in the upper right corner of RStudio, then click `Build Website`
2. Check out the website settings in `_site.yml`.  These adjust the appearance, title, etc.
3. Check out `_navbar.yml`.  These settings define the menus, etc.  If you only have one page you probably won't need to adjust this information.  

## Push to GitHub and enable the website
1. Select the `Git` tab in the upper right and notice how it keeps track of any changes.
  * To 'commit' the files (which is like saving them), check the files you want to commit (or all of them) and click `commit`.
  *  Type in a brief message about the changes you made.  Maybe something like "First update to my project materials"
  * Click `Commit`, then `close`.
  * Click `Push` to push it back up to GitHub.
2. Now go to your repository website (similar to [https://github.com/AdamWilsonLab/RDataScience_Project](https://github.com/AdamWilsonLab/RDataScience_Project) in your account)
3. Click settings in the upper right, then scroll down to `GitHub Pages` section
   * Source: `master branch /docs folder`
4. Go to your new project webpage (URL will be similar to [http://adamwilson.us/RDataScience_Project/]( http://adamwilson.us/RDataScience_Project/))
5.  Now you can `commit` and then `push` your updates and your website will be updated.  If you get tired of entering your username and password every time, check out the instructions [here](GitSSHNotes.html).  

## Explore markdown functions

1. Use the Cheatsheet to add sections and some example narrative.  
2. Try changing changing the species name to your favorite species and re-run the report. 
3. Add more figures or different versions of a figure
4. Check out the `kable()` function for tables (e.g. `kable(head(d))`)
