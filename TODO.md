# Structure updates
Add a datacamp course for each/most of the 14 case studies
Use datacamp education for instruction/assignments
Then class time for questions/case studies

Grading changes
30% datacamp
30% final project
30% participation: tasks, and case studies
10% leadership (package presentation, leading a study group)

Package presentation?  IF keeping, use a Rmd structure inside course repositories so they can be opened on the fly. 

For grade: include letter to instructor with grade request.

Schedule Page (one row per week with):
